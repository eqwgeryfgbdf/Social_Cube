# Deprecated Code Repository

## Warning

**The code in this directory is deprecated and scheduled for removal.** 

Scripts and files in this directory are being maintained temporarily to ensure a smooth transition but will be removed according to the timeline in the removal plan.

## Purpose

This directory serves as a transitional location for code that has been identified for removal but needs to remain temporarily functional. By moving deprecated code here instead of removing it immediately, we:

1. Clearly mark it as deprecated and scheduled for removal
2. Provide a transitional period for dependent code to be updated
3. Ensure all team members are aware before permanent deletion

## Removal Timeline

All code in this directory is scheduled for removal according to the timeline specified in [docs/removal_plan.md](../docs/removal_plan.md).

## How to Proceed

If you find yourself needing to use code from this directory:

1. **DON'T** add new dependencies to anything in this directory
2. **DO** refactor your code to remove dependencies on deprecated code
3. **CONSIDER** migrating functionality you need to maintained code

## Restoration Process

If you believe code in this directory should not be removed, please:

1. Contact the repository maintainer immediately
2. Provide a clear justification for retaining the code
3. Suggest where and how the code should be maintained

## Backup Information

All code scheduled for removal has been backed up. If you need access to removed code after cleanup is complete, refer to the backup and restoration instructions in [docs/verification_report.md](../docs/verification_report.md).
