# Testing Strategy for Refactored Components

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the refactored components in the Social Cube project, particularly focusing on utility functions and service-layer components that have been refactored to eliminate duplicate code patterns.

## Target Components

The following refactored components are covered by the testing strategy:

1. **Core Utilities**
   - `utils/common.py`: Common utility functions
   - `utils/error_handling/*.py`: Error handling utilities

2. **Service Layer Components**
   - `dashboard/utils/discord_api.py`: Discord API integration
   - `dashboard/utils/token_storage.py`: Authentication token management
   - `bot_management/api.py`: Bot management API
   - `dashboard/decorators.py`: Authentication and permission decorators
   - `dashboard/middleware.py`: Request handling middleware
   - `dashboard/auth_backends.py`: Custom authentication backends

## Test Organization

Tests are organized following these principles:

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Tests are placed in a `tests` directory within the module being tested
   - Test file names follow the pattern `test_<module_name>.py`
   - Shared fixtures are placed in `conftest.py` files

2. **Test Classification**
   - Unit tests: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
   - Integration tests: Test interactions between components
   - Functional tests: Test end-to-end functionality

3. **Test Naming**
   - Test functions follow the pattern `test_<function_name>_<scenario>_<expected_result>`
   - Test classes follow the pattern `Test<ClassBeingTested>`

## Test Fixtures and Mocks

1. **Shared Fixtures**
   - `utils/tests/conftest.py`: Common fixtures for utility testing
   - `dashboard/utils/tests/conftest.py`: Fixtures for dashboard components

2. **Mock Strategies**
   - External API calls are mocked using `unittest.mock.patch` or `responses` library
   - Database operations use Django's test database features
   - Time-sensitive tests use `freezegun` to mock the current time

## Coverage Goals

1. **Line Coverage Targets**
   - Core utilities: 90% minimum
   - Service layer components: 85% minimum
   - Overall: 80% minimum

2. **Coverage Exclusions**
   - Migration files
   - Admin configurations
   - URL routing

3. **Critical Paths**
   - Authentication and security-related code: 100% coverage
   - Error handling pathways: 100% coverage
   - Data validation: 100% coverage

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests with coverage reporting
python run_tests_with_coverage.py

# Generate HTML coverage report
python run_tests_with_coverage.py --html

# Test specific modules
python run_tests_with_coverage.py --modules utils.common dashboard.utils.discord_api
```

## Continuous Integration

1. **Automated Test Runs**
   - Tests run on every pull request
   - Full coverage report generated for review

2. **Coverage Requirements**
   - PRs must maintain or improve coverage percentages
   - Failed coverage requirements block PR merging

## Test Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Tests must be updated when components change
   - Test fixtures should be reviewed for realism periodically

2. **Test Quality Review**
   - Regular reviews of test quality and coverage
   - Identification of gaps in coverage

## Known Limitations

1. **Areas with Limited Coverage**
   - Third-party service integrations with limited testability
   - UI-specific logic that requires browser testing

2. **Future Improvements**
   - Integration of property-based testing
   - Enhanced mocking of Discord API responses
   - Performance benchmark tests
