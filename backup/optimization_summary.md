# Frontend Asset Optimization Summary

## Assets Removed

| Category | Files Removed | Total Size (Uncompressed) |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| JavaScript | 3 | ~18KB |
| CSS | 2 | ~10KB |
| Images | 2 | ~2KB |
| **Total** | **7** | **~30KB** |

## Optimization Benefits

- Reduced maintenance burden by removing unused assets
- Simplified codebase by eliminating redundant files
- Reduced build time by having fewer assets to process
- Better organization with clearer distinction between used and unused assets
- Foundation for further optimization in subsequent tasks

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Implement WebP conversion for remaining images
2. Set up a build process with proper minification
3. Gradually consolidate to a single CSS framework
4. Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources

This optimization is part of the larger cleanup initiative to improve application performance and maintainability.
