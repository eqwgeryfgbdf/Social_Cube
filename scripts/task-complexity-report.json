      "taskTitle": "Scan and Remove Unused Frontend Assets",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List and describe the main subtasks required to systematically identify, document, back up, and safely remove all unused frontend assets (images, stylesheets, JS files). Include steps for tool usage, cross-referencing, documentation, backup, staged removal, and post-removal testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires thorough codebase analysis, tool integration, careful documentation, and safe removal practices to avoid breaking the application. The process involves multiple checks, backups, and iterative validation, making it moderately complex."

      "taskTitle": "Refactor Duplicate Logic in Backend Services and Utils",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the steps to identify, consolidate, and refactor duplicate code across backend services and utility functions. Include analysis, creation of shared modules, migration, and updating of tests and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Refactoring duplicate backend logic is complex due to the need for code analysis, impact assessment, careful migration to shared modules, and ensuring backward compatibility without altering behavior."
    },

      "taskId": 16,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Unit Test Coverage for Refactored Backend Services",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define subtasks to identify refactored code, design comprehensive unit tests (including edge cases and error handling), implement fixtures/mocks, and update or add documentation and affected tests.",
      "reasoning": "While unit testing is a standard process, achieving robust coverage for newly refactored logic requires careful mapping and validation, especially to ensure no regressions or missed edge cases."
    },

      "taskId": 17,
      "taskTitle": "Apply Asset Compression and Minification for Static Files",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the subtasks involved in implementing a full pipeline for compression and minification of static files, including tool selection, build process integration, server configuration, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "The task spans multiple asset types and requires integrating and configuring several tools, build systems, and server settings, along with validation and documentation."

      "taskId": 18,
      "taskTitle": "Clean Up Deprecated Feature Branches and Legacy Scripts",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to inventory, document, back up, and safely remove deprecated branches and scripts, including dependency checks, staged removal, and documentation updates.",
      "reasoning": "The process is well-defined and procedural, with most complexity arising from ensuring nothing important is deleted and that changes are well-documented."

      "taskTitle": "Dependency Audit and Optimization for JavaScript and Python Packages",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the main subtasks to audit, categorize, optimize, and document dependencies for both JavaScript and Python, including tool usage, security analysis, and reporting.",
      "reasoning": "Auditing and optimizing dependencies across two ecosystems is intricate, requiring deep code analysis, tool integration, risk management, and thorough documentation."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Loading for Non-Critical Application Modules",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the subtasks for identifying non-critical modules, refactoring code for dynamic/lazy loading, updating build configurations, adding loading/error handling UI, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity architectural change touching module boundaries, build tooling, user experience, and requires careful validation to avoid regressions."
    },

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the steps to analyze schema usage, verify references, plan and execute migrations, and document all changes, considering data backup and compliance.",
      "reasoning": "Database schema changes are sensitive and risky, requiring careful analysis, staged implementation, and rollback strategies to avoid data loss or service disruption."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Identify the subtasks to analyze current Dockerfiles, implement multi-stage builds and layer optimizations, remove unnecessary files, and document results.",
      "reasoning": "Image optimization involves several well-understood techniques but can become complex depending on image structure and application dependencies."
