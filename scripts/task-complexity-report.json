      "taskTitle": "Set up Django Project Structure and Environment",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Django project setup into subtasks covering: 1) Initial project creation and app structure, 2) Database configuration, 3) Environment and dependency management, and 4) Version control setup",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves multiple components (project structure, database setup, environment configuration, dependencies). It's foundational for the project but follows standard Django practices. Breaking it into 4 distinct areas will make the setup more manageable."

      "reasoning": "Frontend development has significant complexity due to the need for responsive design, multiple interconnected pages, and real-time data display. The task requires both design skills and frontend implementation across various system components."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Logging System and Error Handling",
      "complexityScore": 6,
