# Branch and Script Removal Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased approach for removing deprecated branches and legacy scripts from the Social Cube project. The plan is designed to minimize disruption while ensuring all team members have adequate notice and opportunity to review before permanent removal.

## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Timeline | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Mark items for deletion with clear notices | Week 1 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Phase 2** | Move scripts to 'deprecated' folder (but keep functional) | Week 2 | üîÑ In Progress |
| **Phase 3** | Complete removal after team approval | Week 3 | ‚è±Ô∏è Scheduled |

## Items to Be Removed

### Git Branches

Based on the verification performed, the following branches have been identified for removal:

1. **task/discord-bot-management-ui__1** - Fully merged into main, appears to be a duplicate of the active feature branch

### Scripts and Legacy Files

No scripts have been identified for immediate removal in this cleanup cycle. The analysis of script usage patterns will be continued in future cleanup activities.

## Phase 1: Marking Items for Deletion (Complete)

- ‚úÖ Created inventory of branches and scripts (see [branch_script_inventory.md](branch_script_inventory.md))
- ‚úÖ Performed verification analysis (see [verification_report.md](verification_report.md))
- ‚úÖ Created backups of all items marked for removal in `backup/cleanup_backup/`
- ‚úÖ Created this removal plan document with clear timelines

## Phase 2: Transitioning Items to Deprecated Status (In Progress)

- üîÑ Create `deprecated/` folder for scripts that will be moved
- üîÑ Update relevant documentation to indicate deprecation status
- üîÑ Send notification email to all team members with the removal plan and schedule a review meeting
- üîÑ Create the first pull request for moving scripts to the deprecated folder

## Phase 3: Final Removal (Scheduled)

- ‚è±Ô∏è Schedule final review meeting with team
- ‚è±Ô∏è Process feedback and finalize the list of items to be removed
- ‚è±Ô∏è Create the final pull request for complete removal of deprecated items
- ‚è±Ô∏è Verify all CI/CD pipelines and build processes continue to function
- ‚è±Ô∏è Update documentation to reflect the completed cleanup

## Notification System

### Email Template

```
Subject: ACTION REQUIRED: Upcoming Removal of Deprecated Branches and Scripts

Dear Team,

We're planning to remove several deprecated branches and legacy scripts from our codebase to improve maintainability and reduce clutter.

WHAT'S BEING REMOVED:
- Branch: task/discord-bot-management-ui__1 (fully merged)
- No scripts identified for removal at this time

TIMELINE:
- Week 1 (Now): Items marked for deletion with notices
- Week 2 (Next week): Scripts moved to deprecated folder (if any)
- Week 3 (Following week): Complete removal after approval

ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Review the full inventory and verification reports:
   - Branch and Script Inventory: [link]
   - Verification Report: [link]
   - Removal Plan: [link]
2. Attend the review meeting on [DATE] at [TIME]
3. Raise any concerns by replying to this email before [DEADLINE]

All items scheduled for removal have been backed up and can be restored if needed. The backup location is documented in the verification report.

Thank you for your cooperation in keeping our codebase clean and maintainable.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Review Meeting Agenda

1. Overview of cleanup process and goals (5 minutes)
2. Review of items marked for removal (10 minutes)
3. Discussion of potential impacts (10 minutes)
4. Q&A and concerns (10 minutes)
5. Next steps and approval (5 minutes)

## Testing Process

After each phase, the following tests will be performed:

1. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
2. Verify all CI/CD pipelines still function correctly
3. Conduct manual testing of key application workflows

## Backup and Recovery

All items scheduled for removal have been backed up in `backup/cleanup_backup/`. The backup includes:

- Git branch bundles (complete history)
- Git branch patches (text-based diffs)
- Full copies of scripts with original directory structure

Recovery instructions are documented in [verification_report.md](verification_report.md).

## Future Prevention Measures

To prevent accumulation of deprecated branches and unused scripts in the future, we're implementing the following guidelines:

1. **Branch Lifecycle Management:**
   - Clear naming conventions with date suffixes
   - Regular cleanup of merged branches (bi-weekly)
   - Maximum branch lifetime policy (3 months for inactive branches)

2. **Script Management:**
   - Documentation requirements for all new scripts
   - Quarterly usage analysis and cleanup
   - Centralized script documentation

These guidelines will be formalized in the project documentation after the current cleanup is complete.
