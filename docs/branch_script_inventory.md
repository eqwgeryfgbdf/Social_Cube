# Branch and Script Inventory Report

## Branch Inventory

Based on our analysis, the repository contains the following branches:

1. **main** - Main development branch
2. **task/discord-bot-management-ui_2025-04-25_1** - Active feature branch, contains most recent development
3. **task/discord-bot-management-ui__1** - Possibly a duplicate or backup of the feature branch

### Branch Status Summary

- **Total branches**: 3
- **Active branches**: 1 (task/discord-bot-management-ui_2025-04-25_1)
- **Merged branches**: 2 (main, task/discord-bot-management-ui__1)
- **Stale branches**: 0 (no branches older than 90 days)

### Recommendations

- Branch **task/discord-bot-management-ui__1** appears to be duplicative of **task/discord-bot-management-ui_2025-04-25_1** and could potentially be removed after verification that all changes have been properly integrated.
- Implement a branch naming convention to improve clarity. Consider a format like: `type/feature-description_YYYY-MM-DD` where type is one of: feature, bugfix, hotfix, etc.
- Clean up duplicate branch: `task/discord-bot-management-ui__1` once work is complete.

## Script Inventory

The repository contains approximately 173 Python files along with various shell scripts (.sh), batch files (.bat), and JavaScript files (.js).

### Identified Script Categories

1. **Core Application Scripts**: Scripts central to the application functionality (in api/, bot_management/, dashboard/, etc.)
2. **Deployment Scripts**: Files like deploy.sh, deploy.bat, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
3. **Development Scripts**: run_dev.sh, run_dev.bat, setup_env.py, run_tests_with_coverage.py
4. **Utility Scripts**: Scripts in the scripts/ directory like generate_secrets.py, backup.sh, etc.

### Potentially Redundant Scripts

Based on the analysis, we've identified the following scripts that may warrant further review:

1. **run_dev.sh** and **run_dev.bat** - These serve the same purpose on different platforms; keeping both is justified.
2. **deploy.sh** and **deploy.bat** - These serve the same purpose on different platforms; keeping both is justified.
3. **backup/**: This directory contains duplicate files that appear to be backups of current code. These should be verified and potentially removed if they are outdated.

### Recommendations

1. **Documentation**: Add improved comments and documentation to all scripts, especially those in the scripts/ directory to clarify their purpose and usage.
2. **Consolidation**: Consider consolidating similar scripts where possible (e.g., combining related database scripts).
3. **Removal**: After proper verification, the backup directory could be cleaned up if it contains outdated copies of files.
4. **Standardization**: Implement consistent error handling, logging, and parameter validation across all scripts.

## Future Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Branch Policy**: Implement a branch lifecycle policy that includes:
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Regular cleanup of merged branches
   - Periodic review of stale branches (e.g., quarterly)

2. **Script Management**:
   - Document all scripts in a central location
   - Include clear purpose, usage examples, and dependencies
   - Add headers to all scripts with date, author, and purpose
   - Regularly review and update scripts to ensure they remain compatible with the evolving codebase

3. **Automated Cleanup**:
   - Consider implementing an automated periodic check using the tools created for this task
   - Schedule regular cleanup sessions (e.g., monthly) to prevent accumulation of unnecessary code

## Tools Created

As part of this task, the following tools were created to help with ongoing maintenance:

1. **branch_script_analyzer.py**: A comprehensive Python script that analyzes branch status and script usage patterns.
2. **branch_script_analyzer.ps1**: A PowerShell version of the analysis script for Windows environments.
3. **simple_branch_analyzer.py**: A simplified version that provides basic branch and script analysis.
4. **run_branch_analyzer.bat**: A batch file to run the appropriate analyzer based on the available environment.

These tools can be found in the `scripts/` directory and should be run periodically to maintain repository hygiene.
