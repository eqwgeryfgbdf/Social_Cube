### Script References

## Backup Information

All backups are stored in the `backup/cleanup_backup` directory.

### Branch Backups

Branches have been backed up in two formats:

- **Bundle files**: `backup/cleanup_backup/branches/bundles/*.bundle` - Complete branch history in Git bundle format
- **Patch files**: `backup/cleanup_backup/branches/patches/*.patch` - Text-based patches that can be applied to a repository

To restore a branch from a bundle:

```bash
# Create a new branch from the bundle
git bundle unbundle path/to/branch_name.bundle
git checkout -b restored_branch_name branch_name
```

To apply a patch:

```bash
# Apply the patch to the current branch
git apply path/to/branch_name.patch
```

### Script Backups

Scripts have been backed up to the `backup/cleanup_backup/scripts` directory with their original directory structure preserved.

To restore a script:

```bash
# Simply copy the file back to its original location
cp backup/cleanup_backup/scripts/path/to/script.py path/to/script.py
```
